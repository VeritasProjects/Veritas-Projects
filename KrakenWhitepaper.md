Kraken Whitepaper
Project Kraken 

Project Kraken was inspired by the popular “buyback wallet” trend. Our team dove into the communities in which this tokenomic was being employed and gathered up countless examples as to what you all wanted to see used .We have worked through the feedback in order  to fix the broken mechanics in what is otherwise a solid theory and this is what the team came up with.

buys

All too common complaint was not enough rewards or incentives for investors to hold and not simply join in on the dump following buybacks. The reflection to all buyers will prove to be a lucrative perk for those holding through Kraken buybacks and will be further amplified with our “Kraken Events”
5% -redistribution – huge rewards from Kraken buyback and FOMO
5% - burn – adds a little more incentive to hold from those chasing the pump
5% - lottery wallet – Daily draws with plenty of variations to make sure everyone has chances to win

sells

7.5% dev tax – not in tokens so the chart impact is avoided
17.5 % kraken wallet – Proper use of buybacks, holding the floor at key levels, and pumping to new ATH. 
Using a modified version of one of the best punishment systems in the game, we believe this addresses the problems which plagued Whale Wallet predecessors. No one likes it when investors chase pumps and then promptly seek to dump on the loyal investors who believe in what we are doing. This enables us to more efficiently hold floors while still allowing profits to be taken without causing the chart to freefall.
Max 2.9% price impact limit on sells  
1st sell – 7.5% dev tax 17.5% whale wallet tax
(1 hour)
2nd sell – 10.5% dev tax 19.5% whale wallet tax
(2 hours) 
3rd sell – 10% dev tax 25% whale wallet tax
(3hours) 
4th sell – 10% dev tax 25% whale wallet tax

sell timer resets 24 hours after the first sell and there is a maximum of 4 sells within any 24 hour window

The kraken wallet will also be used to seek potential promotional opportunities, community giveaways, and special events held throughout the lifespan of  Kraken


ENDGAME
Meet the endgame – Once our project reaches the end of the one month lifecycle, we plan to infuse the entirety of the Kraken Wallet into the chart so each and every holder gets a chance to cash out in a coordinated community selloff. This is where the trust built up throughout the duration of our project pays off for the community, and for the team.
