Kraken Whitepaper
Project Kraken 

Project Kraken was inspired by the popular “buyback wallet” trend. Our team dove into the communities in which this tokenomic was being employed and gathered up countless examples as to what you all wanted to see used .We have worked through the feedback in order  to fix the broken mechanics in what is otherwise a solid theory and this is what the team came up with.

buys

All too common complaint was not enough rewards or incentives for investors to hold and not simply join in on the dump following buybacks. The reflection to all buyers will prove to be a lucrative perk for those holding through Kraken buybacks and will be further amplified with our “Kraken Events”

7% -redistribution – huge rewards from Kraken buyback and FOMO

5% - lottery wallet – Daily draws with plenty of variations to make sure everyone has chances to win

sells

8% dev tax 

17% kraken wallet 

Using a modified version of one of the best punishment systems in the game, we believe this addresses the problems which plagued Whale Wallet predecessors. No one likes it when investors chase pumps and then promptly seek to dump on the loyal investors who believe in what we are doing. This enables us to more efficiently hold floors while still allowing profits to be taken without causing the chart to freefall.

ENDGAME
Kraken has a lifespan and is never intended to continue to a point beyond the initial liquidity lock. What makes us different is we have plans in place to make sure everyone who stuck around until the end will have an opportunity to sell their positions at a lower tax rate instead of being forced to sell at a loss due to frustration or a project having no exit strategy. We want to offer everyone plenty of chances to take profit along the way and our “endgame” is a way of us saying thank you to the everyone who supported us along the way.
